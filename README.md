Use of Semantics in HTML

Semantics have been a part of html in some form or another. It helps you understand what's happening where on the page.

The benefit of writing semantic HTML stems from the goal of a web pageâ€”to communicate. And by adding semantic tags to your documents, you are providing additional information about your document, which aids in communication and goes beyond just how they look on a page.
These tags help in proper structuring and understanding of the layout.

Earlier when <div> was used for pretty much everything, we still implemented semantics by giving it a "semantic" class name or an id name.

### Examples
Various Semantic Tags

* <code> - Code reference
* <h1> - First level headline

* Footer: The <footer> element specifies a footer for a document or section.

<footer>
  <p>Posted by: Hege Refsnes</p>
  <p>Contact information: <a href="mailto:someone@example.com">
    someone@example.com</a>.</p>
  </footer>

* Nav tag: The <nav> element is intended for large blocks of navigation links. However, not all links in a document should be inside a <nav> element!

<nav>
<a href="/html/">HTML</a> |
<a href="/css/">CSS</a> |
<a href="/js/">JavaScript</a> |
<a href="/jquery/">jQuery</a>
</nav>

* Aside Tag: The <aside> element defines some content aside from the content it is placed in (like a sidebar).

<p>My family and I visited The Epcot center this summer.</p>
<aside>
  <h4>Epcot Center</h4>
  <p>The Epcot Center is a theme park in Disney World, Florida.</p>
</aside>

#### Not Recommended

Some of the most commonly misused semantic tags include:

* <Blockquote>: Should not use it to indent text. Use CSS margins instead.
* <P>: Avoid <p>&nbsp;</p> to add extra space between page elements.
* <h1> to <h6>: The header tags can be used to make fonts bigger and bolder, but if the text is not a headline, it should not be inside a headline tag. Use the font-weight and font-size CSS properties instead.
